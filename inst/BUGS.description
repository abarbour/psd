[OPEN] 002_preprocflag
The preprocessing flags (e.g., in 'plot') are not reflective of the
actual preprocessing in the final product.

[OPEN] 001_firstlast
The first and last values of the spectra are strangely very low. The solution
thus far is to extrapolate values, which is precarious; however, those points
are very nearly useless for most applications of power spectral density
estimates.
