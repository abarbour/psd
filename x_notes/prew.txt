prewhiten nar: The R&S multitapers do not exhibit the remarkable
spectral-leakage suppression properties of the Thomson tapers, so
that in spectra with large dynamic range, power bleeds from the
strong peaks into neighboring frequency bands of low amplitude −
spectral leakage. Prewhitening can ameliorate the problem, at least
for red spectra (see Chapter 9, Percival and Walden, Spectral
Analysis for Physical Applications, 1993). The time series is ﬁrst
ﬁltered in the time domain with a ﬁnite-impluse-response ﬁlter of
nar terms. The ﬁlter is found by solving the Yule-Walker equations
for which it is assumed the series was generated by an autoregressive
process, order nar. Next the multitaper spectral estimates are made
on the ﬁltered series. Finally, the effect of the ﬁlter is removed
by dividing out the spectrum of the autoregressive process.  It is
possible to apply the prewhitening of one series to later time
series by setting nar=−1.  Then the current calculation employs the
prior ﬁlter, provided of course that there has been an earlier
calculation involving prehitening with nar > 1.
