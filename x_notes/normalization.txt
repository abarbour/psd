Andy:

        I think I have resolved my concerns about the spectral levels for
the seismometer data. There is one non-problem, and one small problem.

        The non-problem is that I forgot that the calibration gives the
seismometer response to velocity, so when I corrected the spectra I was
getting dB relative to 1 (m/s)**2/Hz; I am so used to looking at spectra
in terms of acceleration that I just assumed that this was what I had
gotten, and of course it didn't look right. Scaling the spectral numbers
by the calibration and then by omega**2 gives a result quite consistent
with other estimates.

        The small problem comes from the difference in the normalization
assumed by psd (and psdstripd) and logsmoo2. The latter assumes that the
spectrum has the normalization used in  power -- which is that the Nyquist
is assumed to be 1,0, always (power doesn't ask for a sample interval).
But psd assumes that the interval is 1 (unless you specify otherwise)
so that the Nyquist is 0.5. So say you have a white noise with variance
1: power will return a flat spectrum with level 0 db (=1) but psd will
return a level of 2 (=3 db), both so that the level times the Nyquist will be 1.
But logsmoo, told that the interval is 1, will multiply the spectrum by
2 to covert from lc**2/Nyquist to lc**2/Hz: giving 3 dB for the spectrum from
power, but 6 dB (=4) for the spectrum from psd.

        Of course, the problem gets worse if you use the sample interval
in both psd and logsmoo, and this interval is not 1: then the correction
gets applied twice, and is even larger.

        Comparing the smoo files for PFO.II.SZ on 2009:166 with my own
analysis, it looks like for the 1-Hz data that you used an interval of
one for both psd and logsmoo (for psd perhaps by default?): all the estimates
are 3 dB too high.

        The fix is to always specify the interval in psd as 0.5, no matter what
the actual interval is, and then use the actual interval in logsmoo. I don't
see any reason to recompute what is already done: it is easy enough to apply a
shift of -3.01 dB to the results. In fact, it is probably best to leave
everything as it is going forward, and just apply this shift when it comes time
to present results.

        Hope this all makes sense.

Thanks
Duncan

Definition and examples

The decibel ( dB) is used to measure sound level, but it is also widely used in
electronics, signals and communication. The dB is a logarithmic unit used to describe a
ratio. The ratio may be power, sound pressure, voltage or intensity or several other
things these examples. Later on we relate dB to the phon and the sone (units related to
loudness). But first, to get a taste for logarithmic units, let's look at some numbers.
(If you have forgotten, go to What is a logarithm?) For instance, suppose we have two
loudspeakers, the first playing a sound with power P1, and another playing a louder
version of the same sound with power P2, but everything else (how far away, frequency)
kept the same.

The difference in decibels between the two is defined to be

10 log (P2/P1) dB        where the log is to base 10.

If the second produces twice as much power than the first, the difference in dB is 
10 log(P2/P1) = 10 log 2 = 3 dB.

as is shown on the graph, which plots 10  log (P2/P1) against P2/P1. To continue the
example, if the second had 10 times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be
10 log (P2/P1) = 10 log 10 = 10 dB.

If the second had a million times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be 
10 log (P2/P1) = 10 log 1,000,000 = 60 dB.

This example shows one feature of decibel scales that is useful in discussing sound: they
can describe very big ratios using numbers of modest size. But note that the decibel
describes a ratio: so far we have not said what power either of the speakers radiates,
only the ratio of powers. (Note also the factor 10 in the definition, which puts the
'deci' in decibel).

Sound pressure, sound level and dB. Sound is usually measured with microphones and they
respond (approximately) proportionally to the sound pressure, p. Now the power in a sound
wave, all else equal, goes as the square of the pressure. (Similarly, electrical power in
a resistor goes as the square of the voltage.) The log of the square of x is just 2  log 
x, so this introduces a factor of 2 when we convert to decibels for pressures. The
difference in sound pressure level between two sounds with p1 and p2 is therefore: 
20 log(p2/p1) dB   =  10 log (p22/p12) dB   = 10 log (P2/P1) dB       
where again the log is to base 10.

What happens when you halve the sound power? The log of 2 is 0.3, so the log of 1/2 is
-0.3. So, if you halve the power, you reduce the power and the sound level by 3 dB. Halve
it again (down to 1/4 of the original power) and you reduce the level by another 3 dB. If
you keep on halving the power, you have these ratios.
