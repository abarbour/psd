Description: Power spectral density estimates
    are produced through iterative refinement of the
    optimal number of sine-tapers at each frequency.
    The optimization procedure is based on the
    method of Riedel and Sidorenko (1995), which applies
    smoothing that varies with frequency to minimize the sum
    of variance and bias at each point.
