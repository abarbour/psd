Description: Power spectral density estimates are produced through iterative
    refinement of the optimal number of sine-tapers at each frequency. The
    optimization procedure is based on the method of Riedel and Sidorenko
    (1995), which applies smoothing that varies with frequency to minimize the
    sum of variance and bias at each point.
