Description: Produces power spectral density estimates through iterative
    refinement of the optimal number of sine-tapers at each frequency. This
    optimization procedure is based on the method of Riedel and Sidorenko
    (1995), which minimizes the Mean Square Error (sum of variance and bias)
    at each frequency, but modified for computational stability.
