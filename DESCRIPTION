Description: Power spectral density estimates
    are produced through an adaptive method that iteratively
    refines the optimal number of sine-tapers applied at each
    frequency.  The taper optimization is based on the
    method of Riedel and Sidorenko (1995), which applies
    smoothing that varies with frequency to minimize the sum
    of variance and bias at each point.
