#   When a function calling UseMethod("fun") is applied to an 
#   object with class attribute c("first", "second"), the 
#   system searches for a function called fun.first and, 
#   if it finds it, applies it to the object. If no such 
#   function is found a function called fun.second is tried. 
#   If no class name produces a suitable function, the 
#   function fun.default is used, if it exists, or an error 
#   results.
