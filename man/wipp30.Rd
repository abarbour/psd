\description{
The Project MAGNET mission 
provided a wealth of airborne-magnetometer data
spanning the globe (Coleman, 1992).  
This dataset represents a single track of horizontal field
intensities (a very small subset of the full collection!).

\details{
\subsection{Raw and Clean Sets}{
There are non-real data points in raw MAGNET series; these are 
instrumental artefacts, and can severely affect
power spectral density (PSD) estimates.  
A clean series has been included
so that a comparison of PSDs may be made.

Some command like \code{subset(magnet, abs(mdiff) > 0)}
can be used to identify the rows where edits have been made.
