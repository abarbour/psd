The approximate criterion of\r\n[Riedel and Sidorenko (1995)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/78.365298)\r\nis modified to prevent runaway averaging that otherwise occurs when\r\nthe curvature of the spectrum goes to zero.  An iterative procedure\r\nrefines the number of tapers employed at each frequency.  The resultant\r\npower spectra possess significantly lower variances \r\nthan those of traditional, non-adaptive estimators.  The sine tapers also provide\r\nuseful spectral leakage suppression.  Resolution and uncertainty can\r\nbe estimated from the number of degrees of freedom (twice the number\r\nof tapers).\r\n\r\nThis technique is particularly suited to long time series, because\r\nit demands only one numerical Fourier transform, and requires no\r\ncostly additional computation of taper functions, like the Slepian\r\nfunctions.  It also avoids the degradation of the low-frequency\r\nperformance associated with record segmentation \r\nin Welch's method.\r\nAbove all, the adaptive process relieves the user of the need to set\r\na tuning parameter, such as time-bandwidth product or segment length,\r\nthat fixes frequency resolution for the entire frequency interval; instead\r\nit provides frequency-dependent spectral resolution tailored to the\r\nshape of the spectrum itself.\r\n\r\n`psd` elegantly handles\r\nspectra with large dynamic range and mixed-bandwidth features|features\r\ntypically found in geophysical datasets.  \r\n\r\n##Getting Started##\r\n\r\nFirstly you'll need to install the package and it's dependencies\r\nfrom [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psd/)\r\n(from within the `R` environment):\r\n\r\n    install.packages(\"psd\", dependencies=TRUE)\r\n\r\nthen load the package library\r\n\r\n    library(psd)\r\n\r\nWe have included a dataset to play with, named `Tohoku`, which represents\r\nrecordings of\r\nhigh-frequency borehole strainmeter data during\r\nteleseismic waves from the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku \r\nearthquake ([source](http://goo.gl/Gx7Ww)).\r\nAccess and inspect these data with:\r\n\r\n    data(Tohoku)\r\n    print(str(Tohoku))\r\n\r\nThe 'preseismic' data has interesting spectral features, so we\r\nsubset it, and use the areal strain (the change in borehole\r\ndiameter):\r\n\r\n    Dat <- subset(Tohoku, epoch==\"preseismic\")\r\n    Areal <- ts(Dat$areal)\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of spectral estimation, we remove a linear trend:\r\n\r\n    Dat <- prewhiten(Areal, plot=FALSE)\r\n\r\nNow we can calculate the adaptive PSD:\r\n\r\n    mtpsd <- pspectrum(Dat$prew_lm, plot=TRUE)\r\n    print(class(mtpsd))\r\n\r\nWe can visualize the spectrum with builtin methods:\r\n\r\n    plot(mtpsd, log=\"dB\")\r\n\r\nand the spectral uncertainty:\r\n\r\n    sprop <- spectral_properties(mtpsd)\r\n    Ntap <- sprop$taper/max(sprop$taper)\r\n    plot(Ntap, type=\"h\", ylim=c(0,2), col=\"dark grey\") \r\n    lines(sprop$stderr.chi.lower)\r\n    lines(sprop$stderr.chi.upper)\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-34990319-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
