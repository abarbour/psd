(in R) **\r\n\r\nThis work is a port of Robert Parker's (Matlab version of) PSD*\r\n\r\nFrom Parker's site:\r\n\r\n    P.S.D. stands for the Power Spectral Density, often simply\r\n    referred to as the power spectrum, a property of stationary\r\n    stochastic time series that usually provides remarkable insights\r\n    into the physical processes in question. Loosely speaking, the\r\n    PSD gives the energy density in each frequency band; it is a\r\n    statistic of the underlying random process, and so it can only\r\n    be estimated from a given realization, that is, a given finite\r\n    collection of data. There are probably dozens of different\r\n    estimation algorithms for the job. The program psd provides a\r\n    small number of easily used methods, with the intent of providing\r\n    a good spectral estimate without requiring the user to set too\r\n    many tuning parameters.\r\n\r\n    Specifically, psd is based on the sine\r\n    multitaper approach of Riedel and Sidorenko to spectral estimation.\r\n    All spectral estimators smooth the spectrum in order to reduce\r\n    variance; the S-R method applies smoothing that varies with\r\n    frequency to minimize the sum of variance and bias at each\r\n    point.\r\n\r\n* http://igppweb.ucsd.edu/~parker/Software/index.html\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
