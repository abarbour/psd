I've attached the E_z channel of the Scarborough record.  This one of the records I
analysed in my talk for the EM workshop.  

You will see there are sharp lines caused by electronic noise, a nice almost flat spectrum
(which is actually accurately constant when the calibration is taken into account),
followed by a huge fall-off from the front-end anti-alias filters.  The broader peaks are,
as I have mentioned, due to u x B voltages, where the u comes from the shaking the
instrument is experiencing from an ocean-bottom current.  They are due to mechanical
resonances, some high Q, some low Q.  There are several frequency doubles from harmonics
too.

The units are counts and the sampling interval 0.016 sec. The record was begun on May
27,2009 at 6:40, though I'm not sure of that is GMT or local.  David Myer will know.
