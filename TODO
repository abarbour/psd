datasets
--------
[ ] bsm + pp
*** find large teleseism: list with ambient and seismic times
*** include BSM & LSM noise model
[-] scarb
*** should not include? <- proprietary?
[X] magnet

`spectral_properties`
---------------------
[ ] check formulas for various quantities
*** finish documentation [ ]
*** consult Bob

vignettes
---------
[ ] check out resolution
*** is it just uncertainty?
[ ] revise normalization with RLPs suggestions
[X] revise overview with DCAs suggestions
[-] create pdfs to replace <eval=TRUE> statements with <includegraphics>
[X] finish norm
[X] develop overview

Miscellany
----------
[ ] revisit draft for Comp. Geosc.
[ ] Once datasets + vignettes done, final packaging and CRAN submit
[X] bump to 0.2-0
[X] rename? ... to 'psd'
[X] replace rlpSpec refs to psd
[X] change .rlpenv to .psdenv
[X] remove magsat documentation? where?? during build:
	Undocumented data sets:
	‘magsat’
	All user-level objects in a package should have documentation entries.
	See the chapter ‘Writing R documentation files’ in the ‘Writing R
	Extensions’ manual.
	*** offendor was leftover magsat.rda in ./data/
[X] migrate examples in functions to ./inst/Examples/
*** remove --no-examples and get to build [NA]
*** *** why do they not build?? [X]
*** *** because there's some environment thing going on: during example
*** *** checking there is no pointer available to .psdenv.
*** *** Not worth the effort to track down, so just \dontrun{} stuff
[X] normalization function
[X] build --as-cran --no-multiarch --no-examples
[X] remove references to src/ctap_simple.c and test build {[X]}

Examples
--------
[X] test examples
[X] constrain_tapers
[X] parabolic_weights
[X] prewhiten
[X] pilot_spec
[X] psd-environment
[X] psd-normalization
[X] spectral_properties
[X] spec_confint
[X] psdcore
[X] pspectrum (improve)

`psdcore`
-----------
[X] option to prevent environment clashes

`pspectrum`
-----------
[X] ensure normalization occurs only once!
*** in pilot spec or not?!  [X]
[X] option to show final with raw periodogram
*** ensure Nyquist.normalize affects pgram too [X]
[X] improve function documentation
[X] add option to change constraint method for riedsid

`riedsid`
---------
[X] riedsid.spec method
***  test it [X] (looks fine)

demos
-----
[-] fix mag (now in vignette)
*** remove demo file
*** plotting adaptive history [X] (in overview vign)
