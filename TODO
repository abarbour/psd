July 2017

[ ] new class for result of `prewhiten`
*** [ ] and a new pspectrum-method for new class

[ ] identify and remove untested or unstable options
[?] add option for tapcap in pspectrum, rather than hardwire?

[ ] new vignette for time-varying spectra, in Rmd format (knitr)

[ ] possibly restructure code to use `update`
*** [ ] eliminate environment structuring if possible; would need to carry around an fft though -- bloat
