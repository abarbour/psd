Examples
--------
[ ] parabolic_weights
[ ] prewhiten
[ ] pilot_spec
[X] rlpSpec-environment
[X] rlpSpec-normalization
[ ] spectral_properties
[ ] spec_confint
[X] psdcore
[X] pspectrum

Miscellany
----------
[ ] rename? ... to 'psd'?
[ ] Once rename + examples done, bump to 0.2-0
[ ] Once bump, final packaging and CRAN submit
[X] migrate examples in functions to ./inst/Examples/
*** remove --no-examples and get to build [NA]
*** *** why do they not build?? [X]
*** *** because there's some environment thing going on: during example
*** *** checking there is no pointer available to .rlpenv.
*** *** Not worth the effort to track down, so just \dontrun{} stuff
[X] normalization function
[X] build --as-cran --no-multiarch --no-examples
[X] remove references to src/ctap_simple.c and test build {[X]}

vignettes
---------
[-] create pdfs to replace <eval=TRUE> statements with <includegraphics>
[X] finish norm
[X] develop overview

datasets
--------
[-] scarb
*** should no include <- proprietary?
[ ] bsm + pp
*** find large teleseism: list with ambient and seismic times
[X] magsat

`spectral_properties`
---------------------
[ ] check formulas for various quantities
*** finish documentation [ ]
*** consult Bob

`psdcore`
-----------
[X] option to prevent environment clashes

`pspectrum`
-----------
[X] ensure normalization occurs only once!
*** in pilot spec or not?!  [X]
[X] option to show final with raw periodogram
*** ensure Nyquist.normalize affects pgram too [X]
[X] improve function documentation
[X] add option to change constraint method for riedsid

`riedsid`
---------
[X] riedsid.spec method
***  test it [X] (looks fine)

demos
-----
[-] fix mag (now in vignette)
*** remove demo file
*** plotting adaptive history [X] (in overview vign)
