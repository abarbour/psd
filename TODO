performance
-----------
[ ] vapply to C
*** riedsid [ ]
*** psdcore [ ]

Miscellany
----------
[ ] remove untested or unstable options
*** is there a function for deprecation?
*** ctap_markov?
[ ] add option for tapcap in pspectrum, rather than hardwire
[ ] work on bugs
[ ] revisit draft for Comp. Geosc.
[ ] test on R 3.0, CRAN update if necessary
*** I think CRAN checks with devel, which is 3.0.0alpha
[X] make sure ?plot doesn't conflict
[X] fix cran check warnings
[X] final build/check for new CRAN submission
[X] rename? ... to 'psd'
[X] replace rlpSpec refs to psd
[X] change .rlpenv to .psdenv
[X] remove magsat documentation? where?? during build:
	Undocumented data sets:
	‘magsat’
	All user-level objects in a package should have documentation entries.
	See the chapter ‘Writing R documentation files’ in the ‘Writing R
	Extensions’ manual.
	*** offendor was leftover magsat.rda in ./data/
[X] migrate examples in functions to ./inst/Examples/
*** remove --no-examples and get to build [NA]
*** *** why do they not build?? [X]
*** *** because there's some environment thing going on: during example
*** *** checking there is no pointer available to .psdenv.
*** *** Not worth the effort to track down, so just \dontrun{} stuff
[X] normalization function
[X] build --as-cran --no-multiarch --no-examples
[X] remove references to src/ctap_simple.c and test build {[X]}

manual
------
[X] reword AR spectrum section

vignettes
---------
[X] reword AR spectrum section
[X] revise normalization with RLPs suggestions
[X] check out resolution
*** is it just uncertainty?
[X] revise overview with DCAs suggestions
[-] create pdfs to replace <eval=TRUE> statements with <includegraphics>
[X] finish norm
[X] develop overview

datasets
--------
[X] Fix km in magnet (currently all zeros)
[X] bsm + pp
*** find large teleseism: list with ambient and seismic times
*** include BSM & LSM noise model
[-] scarb
*** should not include? <- proprietary?
[X] magnet

`spectral_properties`
---------------------
[X] check formulas for various quantities
*** finish documentation [X]
*** consult Bob

Examples
--------
[X] test examples
[X] constrain_tapers
[X] parabolic_weights
[X] prewhiten
[X] pilot_spec
[X] psd-environment
[X] psd-normalization
[X] spectral_properties
[X] spec_confint
[X] psdcore
[X] pspectrum (improve)

`psdcore`
-----------
[X] option to prevent environment clashes

`pspectrum`
-----------
[X] ensure normalization occurs only once!
*** in pilot spec or not?!  [X]
[X] option to show final with raw periodogram
*** ensure Nyquist.normalize affects pgram too [X]
[X] improve function documentation
[X] add option to change constraint method for riedsid

`riedsid`
---------
[X] riedsid.spec method
***  test it [X] (looks fine)

demos
-----
[-] fix mag (now in vignette)
*** remove demo file
*** plotting adaptive history [X] (in overview vign)
